<h1>Hello there! :wave:</h1>
<p>My name is Henry Morgan (not to be confused with Captain Morgan 🏴‍☠️).<br>I enjoy coding, and I continue to practice by using <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freeCodeCamp</a> and <a href="https://leetcode.com">LeetCode</a>! 💻</p>
<h2>Education 👨‍🎓</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I'm a Computer Science graduate from California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt (formerly known as Humboldt State University).</li>
  <li>To strengthen my skills, I continue to earn certificates from <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freeCodeCamp</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Work 🕴️</h2>
<p>I work for <a href="https://www.nylex.net/">Nylex.Net</a> as an Automation Technician.  My job is to work on projects for clients and the company using my software engineering knowledge.</p>
<h2>Projects 👨‍💻</h2>
<h3>Senior Capstone Project</h3>
<p>For the senior capstone project, I grouped up with three fellow classmates to build a puzzle game about the basics of computer chips.  Our inspiration was from the classwork we'd done in our Computer Architecture class.  In that class, we used logic chips to build more complex chips using a selection of inputs and outputs.  The goal for each project in that class was to connect chips together in a way that every selection of inputs leads to the correct set of outputs.  Our game is called <strong>Assembler Exemplar</strong>.<br>Our GitHub repository is located <a href="https://github.com/SeanFxyz/assembler_exemplar">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Hobbies 🎮<h2>
<ul>
  <li>Playing video games (My favorite series is The Legend of Zelda). 👾</li>
  <li>Taking walks on my freetime. 🚶‍♂️</li>
